# Project Management & Planning Hub

This repository serves as the central hub for high-level project planning, coordination, and documentation for our **Althub** initiative. It's designed to provide a unified view of our project's progress, key milestones, and strategic priorities, ensuring alignment across all teams (Product, Design, and Engineering).

## Purpose of This Repository

This `README.md` and the associated GitHub Project boards will be used by Product Managers to define deliverables, track progress, and communicate updates. While engineering teams will manage their detailed tasks within their respective frontend and backend repositories, this central planning hub will house:

* Overall project timelines and phase definitions.
* The agreed-upon Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope.
* High-level feature specifications and design links.
* Process guides and team-wide documentation.

## Project Timelines

Our project is structured into distinct phases, leading up to the final presentation:

* **Phase 1: Setup & MVP Progress (July 11 to August 20)**
    * This phase is primarily focused on initial setup, foundational work, and making significant progress towards our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

* **Phase 2: Demo Week (August 21 to August 25)**
    * During this week, we are expected to present our completed UI designs, brand identity, and provide a comprehensive walk-through of our product and software development progress. This will also include a discussion of challenges encountered and how we've adapted.

* **Phase 3: Final Development & QA (August 26 to September 22)**
    * This is the critical final development stage where features need to become fully functional, stable, and ready for user testing and Quality Assurance (QA).

* **Refinement & Optimization (September 22 to October 13)**
    * Following Phase 3 and leading up to the final presentation on October 13, our focus will shift to refining and optimizing existing features based on user feedback from testing and ongoing QA.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

Based on current team skill levels and project timelines, our realistic MVP for the **Althub** project will focus on the core functionalities:

* **Tutor Dashboard:** Essential features for tutors to manage their profiles and sessions.
* **Student Dashboard:** Core functionalities for students to find tutors and manage their sessions.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Basic administrative capabilities for overseeing users and sessions.
* **Session Scheduling & Creation:** The fundamental ability for students to book sessions with tutors, and for these sessions to be created and managed within the system.

**Important Note:** Other features such as the **quiz module** and the **resource bank** are considered nice-to-have additions and **are not part of the MVP scope**. Our primary focus must remain on delivering the core dashboards and session management functionalities within the given timeline.
